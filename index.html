							<strong>Master's Thesis: Measuring strength of memberships of nodes in network communities</strong>
							<span class="hidden-phone">
								<br>
								<br>
								<strong>Abstract:</strong> Detecting community structure in networks has been a widely studied area. While most of the methods for community detection produce an exclusive membership of the nodes, the nodes in real-world networks tend to partially belong to more than one community. In this thesis, we study some methods which have been used to quantify the strength of memberships of nodes in different communities (or community-affinity, as we call it) and also define three of our own methods. Our first method is based on personalized PageRanks of the nodes, the second is based on the individual contribution of nodes to the modularity of the graph and the last is based on the common neighborhood between two nodes. We first discuss different notions of community-affinity, each of which is followed by formulations which capture that notion. We then discuss the concept of stability that uses community-affinity scores of the nodes to compute how ”stable” each node is in a given community structure and how can we use this information in estimating the quality of given community structure. Towards the end, we introduce a community detection algorithm, which ”peels” communities one by one from a graph. The results of our experiments show that our algorithm is very accurate even for a large number of nodes in a graph. Our algorithm is fast and it performs very well on real-world graphs compared to the state of the art algorithms.

							<strong>MCMD project: Classification of Twitter Feeds using Apache Spark</strong>

								In this project, I tried to classify tweets from <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a> into classes such as: Personal, Sports, Movies and Music, Politics and Others using a Map-Reduce implementation of Naive Bayes classifier. The classifier was implemented by me using the Java API provided by <a href="http://spark.incubator.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a>

							<strong>Data Mining project: Finding Cricket All-Rounders using Clustering.</strong>
							<span class="hidden-phone"> 
								<br>
								In this project, I present a method which could be used to find out the Cricket players, who play the role of all­rounders for their team. There are two main aspects in Cricket: Batting and Bowling. All­rounders in Cricket are defined as those players who are equally good in batting as well as bowling. The problem discussed in this report is to find such all­rounders from a list of players who have played 20 or more matches from January 1, 1992 to February 1, 2014. The motivation behind solving this problem is to see if we can apply Data Mining techniques on sports data to find some structure in the data. Poster of the same can be seen <a href="files/DataMiningPoster.pdf">here</a>. The data was collected from <a href="http://www. espncricinfo.com/">ESPN Cricinfo</a>.

							<strong>NLP project: Opinion Extraction and Sentiment Analysis System</strong>
							<span class="hidden-phone"> 
								<br>
								In this project, I developed an Opinion Extraction and Sentiment Analysis System (along with my project partner: Arun Allamsetty) to extract positive and negative opinions from raw news text. It involved creating a lexicon from ground up after performing complex analysis to get a balanced recall and precision to get a high F-score.
